 This is the image cache protocol to provide custom image cache for `HBWebImageManager`.
 Though the best practice to custom image cache, is to write your own class which conform `HBMemoryCache` or `HBDiskCache` protocol for `HBImageCache` class (See more on `HBImageCacheConfig.memoryCacheClass & HBImageCacheConfig.diskCacheClass`).
 However, if your own cache implementation contains more advanced feature beyond `HBImageCache` itself, you can consider to provide this instead. For example, you can even use a cache manager like `HBImageCachesManager` to register multiple caches.
